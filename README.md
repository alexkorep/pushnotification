This is a temporary fix for `@aws-amplify/pushnotification` problem
related to migrating `PushNotificationIOS` from `react-native` to
`@react-native-community/push-notification-ios`:
https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/4089

As soon as there is a fix (probably https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/pull/4215),
we should switch to @aws-amplify/pushnotification from npm repository
